# Module auto dialer

The module for MikoPBX provides a REST API for creating campaigns for automatic dialing of external numbers:

* If there is an available agent, the module dials a phone number from the campaign pool.
* When the customer answers, a connection is established with the internal queue number or agent.
* If the internal number is busy, the call is automatically terminated."
