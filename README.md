# MikoPBX Manual

## Foreword

Welcome to the MikoPBX documentation resource! Here you can find step-by-step instructions related to interacting with the MikoPBX PBX system. For your convenience, the documentation is organized into sections—just like in the web interface—making it very easy to navigate.

Thank you for choosing **MikoPBX**! :heart:

## What is MikoPBX?

**MikoPBX** is a **free** telephony server with its own operating system and a simple, user-friendly web interface. It works with virtually any telephony technology in the world.

MikoPBX is a fully modular interface for Asterisk, written in PHP and JavaScript. This means that you can implement absolutely any additional Asterisk telephony functionality within MikoPBX. Moreover, if you develop a useful module, you can place it in the public repository and make it available to all MikoPBX users. Additionally, MikoPBX has very low hardware requirements:

| Simultaneous Calls |  Minimally Recommended Configuration  |
| :----------------: | :-----------------------------------: |
|       5 - 10       |        1 GHz x86-64, 512 MB RAM       |
|      Up to 25      |         3 GHz x86-64, 1 GB RAM        |
|       Over 25      | 2 CPUs 3 GHz x86-64, 2 GB RAM or more |
