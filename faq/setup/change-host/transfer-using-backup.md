# Transfer Using Backup

This method involves creating a backup of your current MikoPBX configuration, transferring it, and restoring it on the new server. Itâ€™s simple to implement and suitable for small systems. This approach is convenient for users with minimal technical experience.

1. First, create a backup of your previous system. You can find detailed instructions in [this article](../../../modules/miko/module-quality-assessment.md).

2. Select the data you want to transfer and wait for the process to complete.

4. On the new host (server) with your MikoPBX installation, restore from the archive by clicking **"Upload backup file"**:

After this, your system will be restored from the archive. This method is ideal for transferring small amounts of data.
