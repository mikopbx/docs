# Connecting to the PBX using SSH

**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a protocol used for secure remote connections and server management. It allows you to run commands, transfer files, and administer systems through an encrypted channel. SSH protects your data from interception by providing authentication and encryption between the client and the server. It is a primary tool for developers, system administrators, and DevOps engineers when working with remote machines.
