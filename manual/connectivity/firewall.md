description: Description and configuration of Firewall rules in MikoPBX

# Firewall

The **Firewall** in MikoPBX is an interface for configuring the system's firewall. Here, administrators can create and manage network traffic filtering rules, controlling access to MikoPBX and protecting it from unauthorized access and network threats. Configuring the firewall ensures the security of the telephone system, preventing potential attacks and ensuring stable operation in the organization's network infrastructure.

In MikoPBX, all local subnets can be described in the "**Network and Firewall**" â†’ "**Firewall**" section. The firewall is designed to restrict access to the station by traffic type and subnets.

## Advanced Options

* Each subnet has a flag 'Is it a VPN or a local network'. When this flag is set, MikoPBX will present itself as a local IP to all local subnets instead of external ones.&#x20;
* The flag 'Never block addresses from this network' should be enabled only for trusted subnets. If this flag is enabled, intrusion prevention rules will not apply to this subnet
