# Night and Holiday Switch

## Purpose

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/1 (20).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this section, rules for operating the station during non-working hours, holidays, and weekends are described. During non-working days, typically no employees are available to answer calls, so a voice notification is played to the caller requesting them to call back during regular business hours.

## Creating a rule

To add a new rule, click on the "**Add Time Interval**" button.

A form for creating a new rule will open.

In the form, you will find the following fields:

* **Period**: The calendar period when employees are absent from the office, such as during New Year's or May holidays.
* **Weekdays**: Specific weekdays for which the rule will be applied.&#x20;
* **Time Range**: The time period during the day when employees are absent.&#x20;
* **Incoming Call Action**: You can choose to **play a sound file** or perform a call transfer. Call transfer options include transferring the call to a conference, IVR menu, queue, internal employee extension, or specific termination numbers.&#x20;

In the **Note** field, you can add a note with a description of the created rule, so that you can quickly navigate through the essence of this rule using this description. With the **eraser button**, you can clear the fields opposite which this button is located.

### Apply only to certain incoming routes

By activating this function, a new menu "Route restrictions" will appear on top of you

Here you can choose which specific routes the rule you are creating will apply to.
