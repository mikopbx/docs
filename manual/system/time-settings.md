# Time Settings

You need to set the time zone correctly to ensure accurate system time display. If the time zone is not set, notifications and call history will be recorded with incorrect timestamps.\


To configure the time zone, go to the "**System**" section and select "**Time Settings**":

{% hint style="info" %}
There is an option to set the time "manually" without using an NTP server. However, whenever possible, we recommend using automatic time synchronization.
{% endhint %}

To manually set the time, toggle the switch "**Adjust the time manually**."
